 * `expect(await …isVisible().catch(() => false)).toBeTruthy()` — the catch
 * swallows the timeout and the matcher then asserts a boolean the test itself
 * produced, so a blank page passes. That shape was green throughout the week the
 * Library screen was unusable, and its Library assertion matched the word
 * "Saved", which was a tab name deleted in #452.
