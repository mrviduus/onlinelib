/**
 * Guest policy is written once, in `src/lib/capabilities.ts`, and nowhere else.
 *
 * The failure this prevents is not hypothetical — it shipped. `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx`
 * derived `const isGuest = !!user?.isGuest` and then used it twice: to hide the edit
 * pencil (`{!isGuest && <Ionicons name="pencil" …>}`) and to hide the danger zone.
 * The pencil is decoration; the `TouchableOpacity` wrapping it still called
 * `startEdit`, so a guest tapping their own name entered edit mode and could
 * `PUT /me/profile`. `pickAvatar` on the same screen had no guard at all. One screen,
 * the policy written twice, one copy right — which is what an inline boolean buys you.
 *
 * A capability name says what the caller may DO (`canEditIdentity`), so a reviewer can
 * see it is on the wrong control. `!isGuest` says only what the viewer IS, and reads
 * plausible next to anything. So the boolean is banned at the door.
 *
 * Scope note: this bans DERIVING the policy, not the concept. `capabilitiesFor(user).isGuest`
 * is fine and expected — reading a decided answer is the point. Only the re-derivation
 * from the raw DTO field, and the bare `!isGuest &&` render gate that always follows it,
 * are forbidden.
 *
 * Same shape as `routeLiterals.test.ts`: it greps, it names the file, it fails loudly.
 * Not a type system. It catches the copy-paste, which is the way this one actually spreads.
