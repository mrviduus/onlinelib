 * In-progress books, most recently active first.

 * Takes the server data the Library screen has already loaded and only fetches
 * what it cannot: the two AsyncStorage maps holding progress written while
 * offline. `ContinueReadingCard` (the old home-screen card) re-fetched library,
 * progress and user-books itself on every focus — three network round-trips to
 * render one card, on a screen that had just made the same three calls.
 *
 * Recomputed on focus rather than on an interval: the only thing that changes
 * these values is the user leaving the reader, which is a focus event.
