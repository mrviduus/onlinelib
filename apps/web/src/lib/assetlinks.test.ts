/**
 * Digital Asset Links — the file that decides whether a link to textstack.app opens the Android app
 * or bounces to Chrome.
 *
 * QA found `pm get-app-links app.textstack.mobile` reporting `textstack.app: 1024` — verification
 * failed — because `https://textstack.app/.well-known/assetlinks.json` answered 200 with the SPA's
 * index.html. Android asked for the statement list and got a web page, so `autoVerify` could never
 * succeed and every https link to a book, plus the password-reset email, went to the browser past an
 * installed app.
 *
 * The file lives in `public/` rather than being placed on the server because vite empties `dist/` on
 * every deploy: anything hand-copied there dies at the next build, anything in `public/` is re-copied.
 * No nginx change is needed — `/.well-known/…` matches no regex location and falls through to
 * `location /`, whose `try_files $uri /index.html` serves a real file when one exists.
 *
 * The fingerprint is not in the repo and cannot be: the build is signed by Play App Signing, so the
 * SHA-256 comes from Play Console or `eas credentials`. Rather than leave CI red for everyone until
 * someone pastes it — which would block every unrelated PR — the strict check activates itself the
 * moment the placeholder is replaced. Until then the file's shape is still pinned, so the one manual
 * step is "paste 32 hex bytes", not "work out the format". See docs/03-ops/android-app-links.md.
