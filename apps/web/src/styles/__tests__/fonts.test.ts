// public/fonts/OpenDyslexic-Regular.woff2 spent months being a GitHub HTML page that
// someone had curl'd and saved with a .woff2 extension. reader.css referenced it as a
// real @font-face, so the "Dyslexic" reader font silently fell back to sans-serif —
// no console error, no failed request, nothing to notice. The same bytes were also
// base64-inlined into the mobile reader.
//
// Static assets are invisible to unit tests unless a test goes looking, so this one
// does. Any font added under public/fonts should get a line here.
