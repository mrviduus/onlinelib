// Mirrors check-mobile-overlay.mjs, which the PDF bundle never had. That gap is
// not theoretical: apps/web/scripts/pdfViewer/entry.ts is the source of the
// viewer that owns the reader's position in a PDF, and an edit to it that ships
// without a rebuild changes nothing at runtime — silently, with a green CI and
// a passing review.
