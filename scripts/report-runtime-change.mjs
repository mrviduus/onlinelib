// Say, on the pull request, when a change moves the mobile runtime fingerprint.
//
// `app.json` sets `runtimeVersion.policy: "fingerprint"`, so an OTA only reaches
// builds whose runtime matches. Move the fingerprint and the change can no
// longer ship as an update — it needs a Play build and a tester cycle.
//
// There was already a guard for this, in mobile-ota.yml, and it works: it
// refuses to publish into a runtime nobody is running. But it runs *after* the
// merge, on main. So it reports the problem to the person who can no longer
// avoid it.
//
// This is the same question asked one step earlier, while the answer still
// changes a decision. It would have flagged the pnpm workspace migration before
// it landed — that PR moved 122 of 135 fingerprint sources into the workspace
// root and stranded an OTA that had been verified working an hour before — and
// it flags every dependency bump that reaches a native module, which is exactly
// the class a bot proposes and CI otherwise waves through.
//
// Deliberately does not fail. Native changes move the fingerprint legitimately
// and often; a check that blocked them would be turned off within a week. It
// tells you which kind of change you are making, and the decision stays yours.
//
// Run: node scripts/report-runtime-change.mjs <base-runtime> <head-runtime>
