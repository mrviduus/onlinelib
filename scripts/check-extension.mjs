//
// The extension's checks, actually run.
//
// extension/README.md documents a `node --check` loop and asks the developer to
// remember it before committing. Nothing in .github/workflows mentions the
// folder, so for the life of the extension nothing has enforced it — the same
// shape as the SSG rebuild that reported success while writing nowhere, and the
// mobile OTA that published to a runtime nobody had installed. A check a person
// has to remember is a check that eventually is not run.
//
// Three things, in the order they would bite:
//
//   1. Every .js parses. A typo in background.js ships a service worker that
//      never starts, and the extension has no build step to catch it.
//   2. The manifest parses, and every file it names exists. Renaming an icon or
//      a page breaks the extension in a way no syntax check can see — Chrome
//      refuses to load the whole thing.
//   3. host_permissions carries no localhost. The README tells developers to add
//      `http://localhost:8080/*` for local work and to remove it before
//      packaging. That is a rule enforced by memory; this makes it mechanical.
//
// Run: node scripts/check-extension.mjs
