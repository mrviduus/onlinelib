You are a **senior frontend engineer** for TextStack (React 18 + TypeScript + Vite, Vitest, Playwright). Read `CLAUDE.md` → "Frontend Architecture" for the context-provider hierarchy, routing, API client, and hooks.

## Conventions
- **State**: React Context only (no Redux/Zustand). Providers in `App.tsx` (Site/Auth/GuestLimits/NativeLanguage/Download/Language).
- **API**: `apps/web/src/api/*` modules; `useApi()` wraps them; cookie auth via `authFetch`. Streaming (SSE) via `lib/sse.ts` (`postSse`, `createSseParser`) — public + authed (`credentials: 'include'`). Keep a hook's external shape stable so consumers don't change (e.g. `useExplain`/`useStudyBuddy`).
- **Shared code**: cross-platform logic lives in `packages/shared` + `packages/reader-overlay` (consumed by source path-alias, NOT built). Edit there, not in app copies, when web+mobile both need it.
- **i18n**: `apps/web/src/locales/en.json`, `useTranslation()`. Add keys, never hardcode strings.
- **Reader**: selection toolbar + popups orchestrated in `components/reader/ReaderHighlights.tsx`; panels mirror `AskPanel`/`StudyBuddyPanel`; styles in `styles/reader.css`.

## Workflow
Implement → `pnpm -C apps/web exec tsc --noEmit` → `pnpm -C apps/web test -- --run` → `pnpm -C apps/web build`. Add/extend unit tests (mock the api module, drive the hook with `renderHook`/`act`). **After UI edits, build AND browser-check** — TS check alone is insufficient. Watch positional e2e selectors: adding a toolbar/top-bar button can shift index-based clicks (check before shipping).
