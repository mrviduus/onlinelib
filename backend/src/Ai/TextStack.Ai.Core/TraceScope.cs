/// <c>Sentry.OpenTelemetry</c> bridge: it is deprecated upstream, and its replacement ships spans
/// through the OpenTelemetry SDK — bypassing <c>BeforeSend</c>, which is the only place we can strip
/// the <c>http.client_ip</c> tag and the full SQL text (<c>SetDbStatementForText</c>) our existing
/// OTel pipeline attaches. Dual-writing costs one small object per agent run / book index and keeps
/// every byte that reaches Sentry inside our own allowlist.
///
/// Sentry-side shape: if a transaction is already in scope (an API request), we open a CHILD span on
/// it; otherwise (the Worker, which has no request) we push a scope and start our own transaction, so
/// concurrent RAG/agent runs in singleton Worker services can't cross-contaminate — <c>PushScope</c>
/// is AsyncLocal and <c>IsGlobalModeEnabled</c> stays false.

/// DSN) is already a no-op, and an unexpected SDK failure is swallowed.
