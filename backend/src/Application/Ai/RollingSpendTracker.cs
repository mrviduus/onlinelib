/// In-memory, process-local per-feature daily (UTC) spend tracker (Phase 12 RLOps slice 4).
/// Backs the ModelGateway's cost-aware routing + per-feature daily budget. Singleton.
///
/// Storage is a lock-free <see cref="ConcurrentDictionary{TKey,TValue}"/> of feature → a bucket
/// holding the UTC day + the day's spend as <b>long micro-dollars</b> (cost × 1e6, rounded), so
/// increments are a single <see cref="Interlocked.Add(ref long, long)"/> with no decimal contention.
///
/// Day rollover: both <see cref="Record"/> and <see cref="SpentTodayUsd"/> compare the bucket's UTC
/// date (via the injected <see cref="TimeProvider"/>) to today; a stale bucket is atomically swapped
/// for a fresh zeroed one before use, so a new day starts at 0.
///
/// Lazy seed: the FIRST touch of a (feature, today) bucket queries <c>llm_traces</c> for today's
/// summed cost on a fresh DI scope and scales it by <c>1/sampleRate</c> for that feature (traces are
/// sampled — e.g. explain at 0.1 → multiply by 10). This APPROXIMATELY recovers spend accrued before
/// a process restart; it is an estimate, not exact (sampling variance + the in-flight window between
/// the seed query and the first post-restart Record). Runs at most once per bucket and never throws.
///
/// 80% alert: when an increment pushes a budgeted feature from below to ≥ 80% of its daily budget,
/// one admin alert email is fired (fire-and-forget, deduped per (feature, day)). All side effects are
/// wrapped in try/catch — this lives on the LLM hot path and the fire-and-forget completion path, so
/// it NEVER throws: <see cref="SpentTodayUsd"/> fails open to 0.
