/// the number. So the unit travels with the value: a client that knows the unit says
/// so, and a percentage that arrives without one is not trusted enough to store.
/// </para>

/// Untrusted writes are not rejected. The locator, the chapter and the timestamp are
/// still the reader's real position and are saved as usual — only the number is left
