/// An uploaded book can be read two ways and they do not share coordinates. The
/// reflow reader stores <c>scroll:&lt;chapterSlug&gt;:&lt;offset&gt;</c>; the
/// Original-layout PDF viewer stores <c>page:&lt;n&gt;</c>. Only one of them is on
/// screen at a time, and only that one has anything true to say about where the
/// reader is.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Nothing stopped the other one from writing. A reader who opened a PDF, read to
/// page 16 and closed the reader had <c>page:16</c> replaced by
/// <c>scroll:2-the-mom-test:0</c> — the reflow path's close-flush, built from refs
/// a PDF viewer never feeds. The stored progress fell from 14% to 4% and the book
/// reopened ten pages early. The client is fixed, but installed builds keep doing
/// it until their owners update, and the web reader has the same gap.
/// </para>
///
/// <para><b>Why the declaration is not just the locator's shape.</b>
/// <see cref="ProgressUnit"/> exists because <c>0.14</c> as a chapter fraction and
/// <c>0.14</c> as a book fraction are byte-identical — the server genuinely cannot
/// tell them apart. That is not true here: <c>page:16</c> and <c>scroll:x:0</c>
/// describe themselves, and <see cref="Derive"/> is a pair of prefixes. A field
/// that merely restated the string would carry no information.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So <c>LocatorKind</c> means something else: <b>this write came from a client
/// that knows coordinate spaces exist</b>. That is not derivable, and it is the
/// only thing missing.
/// </para>
///
/// <para><b>Why not simply rank the spaces.</b> "A page locator outranks a scroll
/// locator" would fix the reported case and break the one that matters more: a
/// reader whose PDF will not render falls back to reading it as text
/// (<c>forceReflow</c>), and that reader is legitimately in scroll space. Ranking
/// would make their position unsaveable forever. Time cannot arbitrate either —
/// the corrupting write happens on reader close, genuinely after the last good
/// one.
