# TextStack — Save to read later — Chrome extension (MV3)

Clip the web article you're reading to your own private TextStack
**Read-later** library. Vanilla JS, MV3, no bundler, no npm.

## What it does

- **Article** pages → extracted locally with Mozilla Readability, then
  `POST /me/books/clip`.
- **Selection** → clip only the highlighted text.
- **Preview & edit** → review/edit the cleaned title/author before sending.
- **Right-click menus**: "Clip page to TextStack", "Clip selection to TextStack".
- **Connect** uses the OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization flow (RFC 8628) — the same
  device flow as the MCP CLI. No new backend.

Clips are private; the server enforces per-user ownership.

## Load unpacked (developer)

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Toggle **Developer mode** (top-right).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `extension/` folder.
4. Pin the toolbar icon, open the popup, click **Connect to TextStack** — a tab
   opens in the web app; approve the shown code while signed in there.

> Real sign-in is **owner-only** — only the account owner has TextStack
> credentials. The Connect flow opens the web app where you log in normally.

## Checks

```sh
node scripts/check-extension.mjs
```

Runs in CI on every pull request, so it is not something to remember. It checks
three things: every `.js` parses, the manifest names only files that exist, and
`host_permissions` carries no localhost entry left over from local development.

The second matters because there is no build step — a renamed icon or page makes
Chrome refuse the whole extension, and no syntax check can see that.

**This replaced a gate that could not fail.** The instructions here used to be a
`for` loop calling `node --check "$f"` by path. On Node 24 that exits 0 on a file
containing `const x = ;` — module-syntax detection swallows the parse error. The
script pipes each file through stdin with an explicit `--input-type=module`,
which reports it.

(`lib/readability.js` is vendored verbatim from Mozilla; see `lib/THIRDPARTY.md`.
It is checked too — vendored code is still code that has to parse.)

## Developer: pointing at a local API

Production default is `https://textstack.app`. To target a local backend:

1. **Settings** (extension options page) → set **API origin** to
   `http://localhost:8080` → Save.
2. **Add the host permission**: edit `manifest.json` and add
   `"http://localhost:8080/*"` to `host_permissions`:

   ```json
   "host_permissions": [
     "https://textstack.app/*",
     "http://localhost:8080/*"
   ]
   ```

3. Reload the unpacked extension (`chrome://extensions` → reload).

Remove the localhost host permission before packaging for the store.

## Owner-only / manual steps

By design, only these are manual (everything else is automatic):

- **Load unpacked** (above) — one time.
- **Real sign-in** — only the owner has credentials.
- **Web Store submission** — packaging + listing is owner-only.

## Notes

- The service worker can be evicted between events, so device-flow state lives in
  `chrome.storage.local` and polling runs on `chrome.alarms` (not `setInterval`).
- All API calls use `credentials: "omit"` and a clean `Authorization: Bearer`
  header (no CORS-with-credentials).
