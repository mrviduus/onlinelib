/**
 * Book-wide reading progress calculation.
 *
 * The WebView/web reader reports per-chapter scroll progress (0..1). That
 * tells the user how far they are through the CURRENT CHAPTER, not the
 * book — so a fresh chapter looks like 0% even on the last chapter of a
 * long book. Footers, ContinueReadingCard, and any progress UI surface
 * need a book-wide percent built from chapter scroll + chapter word counts.
 *
 * Lives in `@textstack/shared` so both mobile and (future) web readers
 * can share the same formula. Pure, no I/O — unit-tested via Vitest.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   bookPct = (Σ wordCount of chapters BEFORE current + currentChapter.wordCount * chapterProgress) / totalWordCount
 *
 * Fallback when chapters lack wordCount (extractor didn't measure them
 * — happens for some legacy user uploads):
 *   bookPct = (chapterIndex + chapterProgress) / totalChapters
 *
 * Returns `null` in degenerate cases (no chapters, unknown slug, denom=0)
 * — callers should render a placeholder like '—' rather than a misleading
 * 0%.

/**
 * The stored book-wide percentage — the ONE way to read a book's progress
 * outside the reader.
 *
 * `computeBookProgress` above exists to PRODUCE this number, from a chapter slug
 * and a scroll fraction, inside the reader that has both. Once written it is
 * canonical (that is what the percentUnit contract is for), and anything else
 * that wants it should read it, not derive it again.
 *
 * The book detail screen derived it, and got two things wrong at once. It passed
 * `savedProgress.percent` — already a BOOK fraction — into `computeBookProgress`
 * as the `chapterProgress` argument, which is a CHAPTER fraction, re-scaling an
 * already-scaled number; wrong for every EPUB, just plausibly wrong. And it
 * derived only when a chapter slug was present, which a PDF read in Original
 * layout deliberately has none of — so a book the list showed at 14% read 0%
 * there, and the same screen started agreeing only once the locator had been
 * corrupted into chapter space.
