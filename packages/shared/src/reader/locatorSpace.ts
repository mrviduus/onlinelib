/**
 * The coordinate space a reading position is written in.
 *
 * An uploaded book has two readers and they do not share coordinates: the reflow
 * reader stores `scroll:<chapterSlug>:<offset>`, the Original-layout PDF viewer
 * stores `page:<n>`. Both wrote to one column, and the reflow path's close-flush
 * replaced a PDF reader's `page:16` with `scroll:2-the-mom-test:0` — 14% down to
 * 4%, the book reopening ten pages early.
 *
 * The client sends this alongside the locator so the server can tell a deliberate
 * move between spaces from a stale writer clobbering the other one's position.
 * The declaration is not the locator's shape — that is derivable, and a field
 * restating it would say nothing. It means "this write came from a client that
 * knows spaces exist", which is not derivable and is the only thing missing.
 *
 * Mirrored in C# by `LocatorSpace.Derive` in
 * `backend/src/Application/ReadingTracking/LocatorSpace.cs`. Change one, change
 * both — the two are a contract, and the tests on each side quote the same
 * locator strings on purpose.
