/**
 * Locating a passage in a document that has changed since it was saved.
 *
 * A highlight, a bookmark or a reading position cannot be stored as a pixel
 * offset or a character index: the text reflows when the reader changes font
 * size, line height, theme, or rotates the device, and re-parsing a book can
 * shift indices outright. What survives all of that is the passage itself plus
 * a little of the text around it — the model Hypothesis and Readium both use.
 *
 * This module is the DOM-free half: given the plain text of a scope and an
 * anchor, it answers "where does this passage start?". Building the anchor from
 * a selection and turning an offset back into a Range need a document, so they
 * stay on each platform — but the matching, which is where the subtlety lives,
 * is shared.
 *
 * It was written three times before this: `apps/web/src/lib/textAnchor.ts`, the
 * resolver inlined into the mobile WebView, and mobile's creator, which captured
 * 50 characters of context while web compared 30 — so an anchor made on the
 * phone scored worse when the same book was opened on the web.
